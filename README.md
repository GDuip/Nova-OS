# NovaOS is the superpower for any device.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79dc5d0b-b794-4d44-b5b4-11dfddafa81e)

NovaOS is a powerful web system built for everything. From daily tasks to endless fun, it has you covered. A customizable system designed for any device with a browser. It offers a fast, secure, and feature-rich experience for gaming and daily tasks, with dynamic personalization and seamless updates.

# What makes it special?
- NovaOS is the **completely free**, **mobile supported**, **PWA installable**, **fully local** **web desktop** system. It has a fully self-created ecosystem of features and a very unique user experience.

- NovaOS is one of the most reliable web systems, thanks to its fully local nature and a codebase built entirely on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

NovaOS can function fully offline^[3], meaning it operates with all its features without an internet connection. Think of it this way: NovaOS is a fully client-side Web application that lets you make full web applications that can interact with a virtual filesystem on the go, even offline. 

- NovaOS can handle locally created web apps in a breeze, SVG icons, powerful settings, massive amounts of detail in each feature and a wide array of default apps to ease your work.

# How do I access it?
NovaOS is available for the public at [https://adthoughtsglobal.github.io/Nova-OS/](https://adthoughtsglobal.github.io/Nova-OS). [^1]
