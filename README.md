# NovaOS is the superpower for any device.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79dc5d0b-b794-4d44-b5b4-11dfddafa81e)

NovaOS is a powerful web operating system built for everything. From daily tasks to endless fun, it has you covered. A customizable system designed for any device with a browser. It offers a fast, secure, and feature-rich experience for gaming and daily tasks, with dynamic personalization and seamless updates.

# What makes it special?
- NovaOS is the **completely free**, **mobile supported**, **PWA installable**, **fully local** **web desktop** system. It has a fully self-created ecosystem of features and a very unique user experience.

- NovaOS is the most stable web desktop system, due to its fully local nature and its pure HTML, JS, and CSS codebase.

- NovaOS can function **fully offline**[^3], meaning it operates with all its features without needing an internet connection. Think of it this way, NovaOS is a fully client-side Web application, that lets you make full web applications that can interact with a **virtual filesystem**, on the go, even offline. 

- NovaOS can handle locally created web apps in a breeze, SVG icons, powerful settings, massive amounts of detail in each feature and a wide array of default apps to ease your work.

# How do I access it?
