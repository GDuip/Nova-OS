This version is not intended for public use. This version is where we release NovaOS experiments for future NovaOS versions. This version can be unstable.

### It doesnt work?
There can be a lot of reasons why.
- The current update is a partial one, and must have patches for it to work.
- The current update is not supposed to work
- The current update is not supported by your browser
- You have used it / any other nova version before

If you have used it / any other nova version before, consider Erasing your device (NovaOS) in the settings or via the boot (NovaOS boot). Contact us if nessesary on our discord: https://discord.gg/atkqbwEQU8
